abstract = {Obtaining text datasets with semantic annotations is an effortful process, yet crucial for supervised training in natural language processing (NLP). In general, developing and applying new NLP pipelines in domain-specific contexts for tasks often requires custom-designed datasets to address NLP tasks in a supervised machine learning fashion. When operating in non-English languages for medical data processing, this exposes several minor and major, interconnected problems such as the lack of task-matching datasets as well as task-specific pre-trained models. In our work, we suggest to leverage pre-trained large language models for training data acquisition in order to retrieve sufficiently large datasets for training smaller and more efficient models for use-case-specific tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach, we create a custom dataset that we use to train a medical NER model for German texts, GPTNERMED, yet our method remains language-independent in principle. Our obtained dataset as well as our pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/GPTNERMED.}

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
